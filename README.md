# Netflix and Charts

An R Shiny app that uses viewing data [available to download](https://www.netflix.com/ViewingActivity) to any Netflix user. The app accepts the .csv from Netflix as input, and uses ggvis to create an interactive Wilkinson dot plot of your Netflix viewing patterns, grouped by month, over a user-specified duration of time.
